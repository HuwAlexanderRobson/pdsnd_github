### Project Title

Assess Demand Profile for US Bikeshare Rollouts

### Description

The project produced an application that provides a set of descriptive statistics for a subset of the population of US bikeshare trial usage that the user can define over cities and periods of time. 
This provides exploratory analysis into the characteristics of the users of the bikes and the characteristics of how the bikes were used. It does this by providing a split values for the statistics over the values of a number of dimensions.
Firstly over each of the three cities included in the trial: Washington DC, New York and Chicago. Secondly over key user characterstics: gender and user type (subscriber - registered user vs customer - a one-time user). 
This can provide answers to key business questions which will inform decisions about how to deploy bikeshare solutions to maximise profit and user experience.

Specifically statistics are provided over the following catagories:
1. Travel Time Stats: when were the bikes used.
2. Travel Location Stats: where were they taken from and what was their destination for each use of a bike. 
3. Travel Duration Stats: how long was each use of a bike.
4. User Characteristic Stats: how many users were subscribers
5. User Birth Stats
